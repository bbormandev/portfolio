          A Bit About Me
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
          I'm a software engineer with a passion for understanding how things
          work. Over the years, I've worked professionally with PHP, Java,
          TypeScript, and Node, and casually with Python and Go for my side
          projects. I've had the chance to build sites using a variety of CMSes,
          several WooCommerce and Shopify plugins, and both public and private
          APIs. I'm currently interested in distributed systems, automation, and
          applying best practices for scalable and testable code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
          Outside of work, I spend time growing a small garden, experimenting
          with my home server, and exploring creative hobbies with my family. My
          home server hosts everything from Plex to Minecraft to self-hosted web
          tools. I like to read (mostly sci-fi and fantasy), play video games
          (mostly strategy and JRPGs), and dabble in a range of different
          hobbies. I enjoy the process of making ideas tangible, whether that's
          building software, growing food, or creating something my kids can
          play with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
          This site will soon expand with writing on engineering experiments,
          personal projects, and the lessons I've learned from both. I hope to
          share technical insights, project breakdowns, and reflections on my
          continuous learning as an engineer. If you're curious about
          technology, creativity, or the overlap between the two, I hope you'll
          enjoy what's coming next!
