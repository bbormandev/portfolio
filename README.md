# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio site built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). The site is hosted at https://bborman.dev, check it out!

## Getting Started

You can also run the site locally by pulling down the repo and running `npm run dev` to start up the development server.

## Hosting

The site is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as a static site.

## Roadmap

I plan to expand on the about me section to give a better idea of the work I do and the interests I have. I also will be adding a blog like feature to highlight projects and experiments that I am working on all in one place.
